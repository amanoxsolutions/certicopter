# Common Errors and Solutions

## Authentication Issues
- **Problem**: Authentication failures when accessing services or APIs (401 error code)
- **Common Causes**:
  - Invalid or expired credentials
  - Missing or wrong environment variables
  - Incorrect API keys
- **Solutions**:
  - Verify credentials in `.env` or configuration files
  - Check if API keys are properly set
  - Ensure environment variables are loaded correctly
  - Check if the provided user has all necessary rights

## Overissued Certificates
- **Problem**: "Overissued" error when trying to solve certificate problems: 
    ```
    An unexpected error occurred:
    There were too many requests of a given type :: Error creating new cert :: Too many certificates already issued for: mydomain.com
    ```
- **Common Causes**:
  - Too many certificate requests in a short time
- **Solutions**:
  - Wait for rate limit reset before retrying
  - Add an additional domain for the issuance in the certbot command
  - If you are testing an instance implement the '--test-cert' flag so you don't run out of available certificate generations

## Networking and API Issues
- **Problem**: Blocked traffic or failed API calls
- **Common Causes**:
  - Firewall rules blocking outbound traffic
  - Network connectivity issues
  - API endpoint unavailability
- **Solutions**:
  - Verify firewall rules and network policies
  - Check API endpoint status
  - Ensure proper network configuration
  - Test connectivity to required endpoints

## Shell Variable Issues
- **Problem**: `$_` in shell scripts causing unexpected behavior
- **Common Causes**:
  - `$_` is part of a credential used in the environment variables
- **Solutions**:
  - Test script in different environments
  - Maybe adapt quotes from `" "` to `' '` or without any quotes (depending on how the environment variables get resolved)
